title: My First Blog Post...Ever!
---

Testing out the functionality of my first ever blog post.  This is being written in Jekyll markdown through the github web interface editor...

Wish me luck on many more posts...more substantive than this...I hope...

# Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

# The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
